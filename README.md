#Glossawy's ComputerCraft API's


This is my repository for the various utilities and programs I plan on writing. All
programs are licensed under the MIT License (Hopefully I remember to put it in the files)
and therefore... basically open to modification and derivation.

The aim is to provide these API's in modules, along with an installer in the future. The modules to be provided are listed below. Each API will have their individual Modules listed for download (for those who only care about a certain part) as well as a "Master" file that will be under the Module name (i.e. - "gui", which contains Buttons, Text, Small Components, etc.). 

#Issues
----------------

Any and All bug's should be reported in the GitHub Issues page! These issues should contain the following:

* Short Description of Problem
* Steps to Reproduce (or Code if possible)
* Error Message

If any of these part's are left out the bug will either not be fixed properly or will take a much longer time to fix than necessary. Thanks!

#Improvements/Suggestions
----------------

Any Add-On's, Improvements or Suggestions should be submitted either to a developer via email/private message or via a pull request. The pull request should describe the change IN FULL, if the description is insufficient or change considered not within the scope of this project then it will be rejected with a reason provided.

You may make multiple pull requests, if your changes gets rejected consistently please contact @Glossawy (no email provided)

#Modules

###GUI
----------------

 A Reliable Graphical User Interface API that is simple and extensible using Object Oriented Programming. Keep it coherent and sane through the power of OOP. Functional Equivalents for certain components are planned, but are very low priority... for me at least.

- [x] Object Oriented Button API (Normal, Radio, Non-Toggle, etc.)
- [ ] Text Input (Fields, Areas, Etc)
- [ ] Pre CC 1.6 Windows
- [ ] Internal Input Processor (Maybe, Ruins Modularity)
- [ ] Small Components (Progress Bars for instance)
- [ ] Scrollable Components
- [ ] More?
- [ ] Functional Equivalents (This is going to take FOREVER)


###Math
---------------

A collection of various Math Utilities that are unlikely to be used by anyone but still makes me curious as to whether or not it will work properly with GUI and Games and so on... you know... those ComputerCraft Games...

- [ ] More Advanced Vector Classes (Rotation, Lerp, Slerp, etc.)
- [ ] Mathematical Interpolation (Various Ways, Lerp, Cubic, Parabolic)
- [ ] Mathematical Utilities (Random Manipulation, Data Normalization, Clamping, etc.)

###Networking
-----------------

TBD, Thinkig about some fun stuff.

###Misc
-----------------

This is just random things recommended or thought of that are miscellaneous utilties or just not fitting any other category.

- [ ] Simplifying Common Programming Algorithms + Wrapping Lua in Expected Feature Names

###Pastebin Codes
-----------------
	
* Object Oriented Button API - 049RGK0g - [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/049RGK0g)

###Notes
-----------------

I do not guarantee that ALL or even MOST of these will be published or finished. I am doing this on free time just for fun outside of my usual Java programming. Family, relationships, work, personal endeavors, etc. can drag me away. This will stay up for as long as I feel it should even if I stop working on it. It is free to forking and contributing. 

I will be active in pull requests and issues if they arise.
